# UAV Billboards - dataset, detection and tracking 

![header](./README_FILES/header.webp)

## Description

We propose a deep-learning-based system for the automatic detection of billboards using consumer-grade unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Thanks to the geospatial information from the device and sensor data, the position of billboards can be estimated.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 1361 images supplemented with additional spatial metadata, together with 5210 annotations in a COCO-like format. It can be downloaded from [(soon available)]().

## System Requirements

* `ffmpeg` - for video conversion

    ```bash
    sudo apt install ffmpeg
    ```

* `exiftool` - for metadata extraction

    ```bash
    sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl
    ```
